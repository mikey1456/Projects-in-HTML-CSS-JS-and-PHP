Projects in Web Development (HTML,CSS,JS, OracleSQL and PHP):

This is my project folder for all the content I did for Web Development during my time in University. Since I started doing Web Development in 2nd year, the school projects will start from second year till third year. 

I covered a wide range of programming and scripting Languages including HTML, CSS , JS, OracleSQL and PHP.
